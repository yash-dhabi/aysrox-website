          <p class="section-intro">
            We are not a generic writing service. We are a focused R&amp;D

                  <strong>We think like reviewers, not copywriters.</strong>
                  We understand how panels, editors, and committees read,
                  decide, and reject.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>We balance global standards with regional realities.</strong>

                <li>
                  <strong>We use AI responsibly.</strong> AI helps with
                  structure and exploration; human expertise leads the reasoning

                AysRox Solutions exists for one reason: to help research and
                innovation move more confidently from idea to impact. Whether
                you’re designing a complex AI trial, writing your first
                fellowship application, coordinating a multi-country study, or
                preparing a thesis that represents years of work, you do not
                have to navigate it alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                We bring together research strategy, communication, and
                responsible AI-enabled workflows so your work can be seen,
                understood, and funded by the people who matter.

              <h3>Do you write my thesis or paper for me from scratch?</h3>
              <p>
                No. We provide ethical support—structure, clarity, editing, and
                research communication. You remain responsible for the research,
                data, and core ideas. Our goal is to help you present your work
                at its best, with integrity.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Can you work with teams outside my country?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes. We work with universities, startups, corporates, NGOs, and
                research teams across multiple regions. We adapt to different
                formats and expectations.

              <h3>Do you use AI tools in your work?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, where appropriate and responsible. AI helps us explore,
                structure, and accelerate routine tasks. Human experts lead the
                reasoning, critical thinking, and final decisions.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>How do you price your services?</h3>
              <p>
                Pricing depends on complexity, depth, and timelines. After a
                discovery call, we provide a fixed-fee quote with clear scope
                and no hidden charges.

              <h3>What kinds of projects do you not take?</h3>
              <p>
                We do not support unethical requests, including ghostwriting of
                theses or fabrication of data. We focus on amplifying real,
                honest work.
